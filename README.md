# Data Collection and Cleaning
The analysis was conducted using two primary datasets:
1. Reviews Dataset: Contains customer reviews with ratings across various categories.
2. Countries Dataset: Provides country-specific information to map review origins.

Data Cleaning Steps:
- Rating Corrections: Identified and rectified invalid ratings (e.g., negative values) by converting them to their absolute positive counterparts.
- Handling Missing Values: Replaced blank entries with null values to ensure data integrity during analysis.

Tools Used: Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and preprocessing.
# Data Integration and Modeling
In Tableau:
- Data Integration: Established relationships between the Reviews and Countries datasets using the 'place' field from Reviews and the 'Country' field from Countries.
- Data Modeling: Ensured accurate data representation by defining appropriate joins and relationships, facilitating comprehensive analysis.

# Dashboard Development
The Tableau dashboard comprises four main components:

1. Summary:
   - Displays key metrics such as average ratings, total number of reviews, and distribution of ratings across different categories.

2. Geographical Analysis (Map):
   - Visualizes the distribution of reviews globally, highlighting countries with the highest number of reviews and average satisfaction levels.

3. Temporal Analysis (Month):
   - Illustrates trends over time, showing how customer satisfaction and review counts vary across different months.

4. Aircraft Type Analysis:
   - Analyzes customer ratings based on different aircraft types to identify any correlations between aircraft models and passenger satisfaction.

Interactive Features:
- Filters: Allow users to drill down into specific time frames, countries, or rating categories.
- Hover Actions: Provide detailed information when hovering over data points, enhancing user engagement and insight discovery.

# Key Insights
- Geographical Trends: Identified regions with higher or lower satisfaction levels, informing targeted improvements.
- Temporal Patterns: Observed fluctuations in customer satisfaction over time, potentially correlating with seasonal factors or operational changes.
- Aircraft Performance: Determined which aircraft types received higher ratings, guiding future fleet decisions.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, integration, and visualization techniques. The resulting dashboard offers valuable insights into British Airways' customer satisfaction metrics, supporting data-driven decision-making to enhance passenger experiences.
